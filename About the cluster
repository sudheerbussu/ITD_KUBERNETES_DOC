Our cluster is a Kubernetes-based system with a single master node running on Ubuntu OS.
It uses the Calico network driver to provide secure and scalable networking for pod communication.
The master node manages scheduling and monitoring, while worker nodes handle task execution. 
The cluster is designed for horizontal scaling, supports containerized applications, and is used for microservices, 
CI/CD, and batch processing. 
We monitor the cluster using Prometheus and Grafana to ensure optimal performance and reliability."
